iOS Project Setup Instructions

This iOS project requires macOS with Xcode installed to run. The following steps are required:

1. Install Xcode from the Mac App Store
2. Open Xcode and install additional components if prompted
3. Install Xcode command-line tools:
   sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

4. Install Ruby (usually pre-installed on macOS, but ensure it's available)

5. Install Bundler:
   sudo gem install bundler

6. Install CocoaPods:
   sudo gem install cocoapods

7. Navigate to the project directory and install pods:
   pod install

8. Open the .xcworkspace file (not .xcodeproj) in Xcode

9. Run tests using:
   - Xcode UI: Product -> Test
   - Or command line: xcodebuild test -workspace OspIos.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace -scheme OspIos -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'

Important Note:
This project cannot be built or tested on Linux or in standard Docker containers. iOS development requires Apple's official tools (Xcode, iOS Simulator, etc.), which are only available on macOS due to licensing and technical restrictions.

Development Options on Non-macOS Systems:
- Use cloud-based Mac services (e.g., MacStadium, MacInCloud)
- Set up CI/CD using GitHub Actions with macOS runners
- Use virtualized macOS in Docker (e.g., sickcodes/Docker-OSX), though this has legal and performance considerations

The current Linux Docker environment lacks Xcode and Swift build tools, so project tests cannot be executed here. Setup must be completed on macOS.
